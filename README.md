## 🔗 Requirements

- **Python 3.12+** (Required)
- [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio) - for final asset unpacking

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install with uv (Recommended)

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is the modern, fast Python package installer and resolver.

```bash
# Install uv if you haven't already
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or with pip: pip install uv

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/InzGIBA/ReWOG
cd ReWOG

# Install in development mode with uv
uv pip install -e .
```

### Alternative Installation Methods

**Traditional pip:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/InzGIBA/ReWOG
cd ReWOG

# Install with pip
pip install -e .
```

**Development Setup with uv:**
```bash
# Install with development dependencies
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run tests
pytest
```

## 🪄 How it Works

1. **Download Weapon List** - Fetches and processes the weapon catalog
2. **Fetch Decryption Keys** - Retrieves keys for each weapon asset
3. **Download Assets** - Downloads encrypted Unity3D files
4. **Decrypt Assets** - Uses XOR decryption to unlock files
5. **Unpack Assets** - Extracts models, textures, and materials
6. **Convert Normal Maps** - Converts Unity normal maps to standard format

> 🗝️ **Note on decryption keys**: the key API only serves the real game client, so
> key fetching may fail with `API error: Server error`. The keys bundled in
> `runtime/keys.txt` cover the classic weapon set. For newly released models,
> capture the keys from your own game traffic — see
> [Capturing Decryption Keys via MITM](docs/mitm-capture.md) and
> `scripts/extract_keys.py`.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

### Quick Start Guide

**Complete Extraction (Recommended):**
```bash
# Extract all weapons with normal map conversion
wog-dump full-pipeline --update-keys --convert-normals
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**
```bash
# 1. Check configuration and status
wog-dump info

# 2. Download weapon catalog
wog-dump download-weapons

# 3. Download and decrypt assets
wog-dump download-assets --update-keys
wog-dump decrypt-assets

# 4. Extract models and textures
wog-dump unpack-assets

# 5. Convert normal maps (optional)
wog-dump convert-normals ./unpacked --recursive
```

### Command Line Interface

WOG Dump v2.3 provides a comprehensive CLI with multiple commands:

```bash
# Get help for any command
wog-dump --help
wog-dump <command> --help

# View configuration and system status
wog-dump info

# Complete pipeline with all options
wog-dump full-pipeline --verbose --max-threads 8 --update-keys --convert-normals
```

> 📝 **Pro Tip**: Use `wog-dump info` to check your system configuration and available storage space before starting large operations.

### Individual Commands

wog-dump download-assets --update-keys

# Check for updates without downloading
wog-dump download-assets --check-only

# Download specific weapons only
wog-dump download-assets --weapons "ak74,m4a1,glock17"
```

**Processing Operations:**
```bash
# Decrypt all downloaded assets
wog-dump decrypt-assets

# Decrypt specific weapons
wog-dump decrypt-assets --weapons "ak74,m4a1"

# Unpack Unity assets to models/textures
wog-dump unpack-assets

# Convert normal maps with backup
wog-dump convert-normals ./textures --recursive --backup
```

**Configuration and Monitoring:**
```bash
# Show detailed configuration
wog-dump info --verbose

# Enable debug logging for troubleshooting
wog-dump --debug full-pipeline

# Use custom thread count for parallel processing
wog-dump --max-threads 16 download-assets

### Advanced Workflows

**Selective Processing:**
```bash
# Process only specific weapon categories
wog-dump download-assets --weapons "ak74,ak47,akm"  # AK variants
wog-dump download-assets --weapons "m4a1,m16a4"     # M4/M16 variants

# Check what needs updating without downloading
wog-dump download-assets --check-only

# Refresh the weapon list from the server
wog-dump download-weapons --force
```

**Performance Optimization:**
```bash
# High-performance setup for powerful machines
wog-dump --max-threads 16 full-pipeline

# Conservative setup for limited resources
wog-dump --max-threads 2 --verbose full-pipeline

# Memory-efficient processing for large batches
wog-dump full-pipeline --chunk-size 4096
```

**Cache Management:**
```bash
# Import weapons.txt / keys.txt into the JSON data store
wog-dump cache --migrate

# Show detailed cache statistics
wog-dump cache --show-cache

# Check that downloaded assets exist and are non-empty
wog-dump cache --validate-assets
```

**Development and Testing:**
```bash
# See what would be downloaded without downloading it
wog-dump download-assets --check-only

# Validate decrypted files after decryption
wog-dump decrypt-assets --validate

# Show full configuration and file status
wog-dump info --verbose
```

### Using as Python Library

```python
from wog_dump.core.download import DownloadManager
from wog_dump.core.decrypt import KeyManager, AssetDecryptor
from wog_dump.core.config import get_config

# Get configuration
config = get_config()

# Download assets
with DownloadManager(config) as downloader:
    successful, failed = downloader.download_assets(["ak74", "m4a1"])

# Decrypt assets
key_manager = KeyManager(config)
keys = key_manager.load_keys()

decryptor = AssetDecryptor(config)
decrypted_files, failed_assets = decryptor.decrypt_all_assets(keys)
```

## 📋 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: What is WOG Dump and what does it do?**
A: WOG Dump extracts 3D gun models, textures, and materials from the World of Guns: Gun Disassembly game for educational, research, and personal use purposes.

**Q: Do I need to own the game to use this tool?**
A: The tool downloads public asset files from the game's servers. While game ownership isn't technically required for the tool to function, we recommend owning the game to support the developers.

**Q: What file formats does it extract?**
A: The tool extracts Unity3D assets including:
- 3D Models (FBX format via AssetStudio)
- Textures (PNG, TGA formats)
- Materials and shaders
- Normal maps (converted to standard format)

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why does it require Python 3.12+?**
A: We use modern Python features like native type annotations (`list[str]` instead of `List[str]`) and improved error handling that are only available in Python 3.12+.

**Q: Can I use this on Windows/macOS/Linux?**
A: Yes! The tool is pure Python and works on all major operating systems. The v2 release removed all C dependencies for better cross-platform compatibility.

**Q: How much disk space do I need?**
A: Plan for:
- Encrypted assets: ~2-5 GB
- Decrypted assets: ~2-5 GB  
- Extracted models/textures: ~3-8 GB
- Total recommended: **10-20 GB free space**

**Q: Is internet connection required?**
A: Yes, for downloading assets from game servers. After initial download, you can process files offline.

### Usage Questions

**Q: How long does the complete extraction take?**
A: Depends on your system and internet speed:
- Fast system (SSD, 8+ cores, 50+ Mbps): ~1-3 minutes
- Average system (HDD, 4 cores, 25 Mbps): ~5-10 minutes
- Slow system (older hardware, slow internet): ~15-30 minutes

**Q: Can I extract only specific weapons?**
A: Yes! Use the `--weapons` parameter:
```bash
wog-dump download-assets --weapons "ak74,m4a1,glock17"
```

**Q: What if the download fails or gets interrupted?**
A: The tool supports resuming interrupted downloads. Simply run the same command again and it will continue where it left off.

**Q: Key fetching logs `API error for X: Server error` / `No key available` — what's wrong?**
A: The game's key API rejects requests that don't come from the real game client. Keys bundled in `runtime/keys.txt` still work for the classic weapon set; for newly released models you can capture keys from your own game traffic with a MITM proxy and import them:

```bash
uv run python scripts/extract_keys.py wog-keys.flows --merge
```

See the step-by-step guide: [Capturing Decryption Keys via MITM](docs/mitm-capture.md).

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I get "Permission denied" errors, what should I do?**
A: Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory, or specify a different output directory:
```bash
wog-dump --output-dir /path/to/writable/directory full-pipeline
```

**Q: The tool seems stuck or very slow, what's wrong?**
A: Try these steps:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Reduce thread count: `--max-threads 2`
3. Enable verbose logging: `--verbose`
4. Check available disk space

**Q: How do I report bugs or request features?**
A: Please create an issue on GitHub with:
- Your operating system and Python version
- Complete error message and traceback
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Output of `wog-dump info --verbose`
